📊 Loan Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project
This Power BI project provides detailed insights into loan disbursement trends, borrower demographics, income and employment influence, default patterns, and clean energy consumption by region and source. It is designed to help financial institutions, policymakers, and analysts make informed decisions using real-world metrics.

📁 Project Overview
This dashboard explores loan distribution behavior, borrower credit profiles, employment and income impact, default risk, and regional energy consumption patterns. The visualizations and metrics are derived from structured data and aim to answer key business questions around lending patterns, borrower risk, and macro-level trends.

📌 Key Insights & Conclusions
🏠 Loan Amount Distribution by Purpose

2. Marital status has minimal impact; Teens and Senior Citizens receive lower loans even with high credit scores.

📦 Total Loan Volume (Adults) by Credit Score
1. Medium and High credit scores dominate loan volume (₹4.6B & ₹4.5B).

2. Very Low and Low scores contribute less, showing creditworthiness strongly influences loan disbursement.

🏠 Loan (Middle Age Adults) by Mortgage / Dependents
1. Total loan volume (~₹3.1B each) is unaffected by the presence of mortgage or dependents, indicating these variables may not heavily influence lending decisions in this age group.

🎓 Loans by Education Type
1. Bachelor’s and High School graduates borrow the most (~₹64K).

2. Those with Master’s or PhDs borrow slightly less, potentially due to better financial standing or lower need.

1. 2015 (+1.3B) and 2018 (+1.73B) showed strong growth in loan volume.

2. 2014 and 2017 experienced major dips, hinting at possible lending slowdowns or policy impacts.
